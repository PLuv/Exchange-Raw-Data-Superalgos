## Repo Info:
- __Who:__  [PluvTech](https://t.me/PLuvtech)
- __What:__ Links to backup copies of the Exchange-Raw-Data required for use at Superalgos Exchange Data Tasks along with their corresponding sha256sums.
- __Why:__
    - Zip files are compressed and data has already been processed by the sensor bot facilitating a MUCH quicker download of Exchange-Raw-Data and install of new markets!
    - By removing the bulk of the exchange-raw-data download burden the data transfer is up to 79% lighter and thus cheaper for those unfortunate enough to be behind meters.
    - *Side-effect benefit:* Alleviates stress on Binance's API.


## Directions:
1. Scroll down the list below to the desired exchange.
2. Click and download the desired market.
3. Unzip to the appropriate location within your `~/Superalgos/Data-Storage/` sub-directories.


### Example:
- You download BTC-USDT.zip for ***Binance*** exchange.
- unzip to: `Superalgos/Data-Storage/Project/Foundations/Data-Mine/Candles/Exchnage-Raw-Data/binance/<-Put_it_Here->`
- *NOTE:* You must ensure you place the __unzipped__ folder (*and all its contents*) straight into the correct ~/Exchange-Raw-Data/<exchange_name> folder as I described above.


### My desired Data is not listed here ??? :
- Get with me either [here](https://github.com/PLuv) or on Telegram __[@PluvTech](https://t.me/PLuvtech)__ to discuss or make a request for additions to this database.  Also please do notify me of any issues directly related to the downloads.
